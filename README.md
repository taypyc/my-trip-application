The Weather Forecast App

A travel planning application where users can see the weather forecast for their upcoming trips to different cities.

Used technology stack: React + Vite, TypeScript, SCSS modules, React Router, axios, React Hook Form.

After launching the program, the user has a list of trips that can be supplemented using a special form. If the list is longer than 3 trips, buttons scrolling through the list appear.

The user can select a trip by clicking on it. After that, the sidebar displays today's weather in the selected city, as well as a countdown timer until the start of the trip. Below, the user can see the weather for each of the planned travel days. Added the ability not only to add, but also to delete trips by clicking on the cross in the corner of the trip card.

The user can also search for a trip among the available ones by name using a special search field. Next to it is a reusable button that filters available trips by their start date. By clicking a second time, the sorting returns to the order of adding trips.

After reloading the page, the data will not disappear, because it is reliably stored in the browser's Local Storage.

The application is fully adapted to different devices (mobile phones, tablets, different laptop or PC screens).

The application is developed with a multi-component approach, has well-separated logic and UI parts.

The application is deployed on the Vercel platform.
